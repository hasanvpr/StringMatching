Throughout this project, I experienced firsthand how different string-matching algorithms 
behave in practice compared to theory. 
The most challenging part was ensuring the correctness of the Boyer-Moore good suffix table—
small indexing mistakes caused large issues. Designing the GoCrazy algorithm required creativity 
and deeper understanding, which made it both difficult and insightful. 
I also realized how important the pre-analysis module is. Choosing the correct algorithm can 
matter more than the algorithm itself. 
There were moments when I got stuck, produced wrong outputs, or had inconsistent shifts, but 
solving these problems accelerated my learning. 
Overall, I found the assignment educational and motivating. It strengthened my skills in 
algorithm design, implementation, and performance evaluation. As feedback, I believe the 
homework effectively combined theoretical understanding with practical application.
